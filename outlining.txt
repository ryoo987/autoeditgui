The features of auto-editor that I want to make ui for

- adding margin
- editing out motionlessness
- editing by decibel level
- exporting what is cut out vs normal exporting
- exporting to editors

- always show progress bar
- dont forget error messages

features i want to make immediately
- drag drop file video file
- use ffmpeg command to see min, max, and average audio level by decibel (audio statistics)
- be able to see the video after cli commands, before exporting

potential future features
- make it a reaallyy basic video editing gui that allows user to make cuts on a timeline
- ^ normal delete and ripple delete
- customizable undo/redo shortcut
- show audio wave form


Outline of steps to take
1. Research GUI frameworks
2. Visually design GUI
3. Code the basic gui
4. Connect cli commands
5. Test it out
6. Repeat 3, 4, and 5 until satisfied!
