### Note
1. For some reason, I cannot resolve an error from Auto-Editor that I have not seen anyone else have with the most updated version. An av error appears for videos using the hevc video encoder, but Auto-Editor works fine for h264 videos. This might be happening only to my personal version of auto-editor, despite being the latest version.
2. Auto-Editor seems to have issues with videos that have variable frame rate. A few others have found their auto-editor creates incorrect cuts due to this issue. I personally get black frames randomly and extremely frequently throughout my videos, and the rendering itself takes much longer than it should. Please use Handbrake or another application to change the video from vfr to cfr (constant frame rate) if you have the same issues.
